<p class="lead">
  Sentry is an event logging platform primarily focused
  on capturing and aggregating exceptions.
</p>

<p>
  It was originally conceived at <a
  href="http://disqus.com/">DISQUS</a> in early 2010 to
  solve exception logging within a Django application.
  Since then it has grown to support many popular
  languages and platforms, including Python, PHP, Java,
  Ruby, Node.js, and even JavaScript.
</p>

<p class="lead">Open Source</p>

<p>
  The hosted version of Sentry, that is, getsentry.com,
  is run by using the open source version of Sentry
  with several additional proprietary plugins. That
  said, nearly every change that is needed for the
  hosted version to work is actually made upstream
  first, usually in the form of an extensible
  interface.

  on <a href="https://github.com/getsentry">GitHub</a>.
