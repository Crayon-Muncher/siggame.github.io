<p>We at Missouri S&amp;T ACM SIG-Game are excited to announce our newest
game: <em>Mars</em>! Mars will be the twelfth MegaMinerAI hosted by ACM
SIG-Game.</p>

<h3 id="whats-megaminerai">What’s MegaMinerAI?</h3>

<p>MegaMinerAI is an artificial intelligence (AI) programming competition
held in Rolla, Missouri on the campus of Missouri S&amp;T. Competitors are
given 24 hours to learn the new game, develop a strategy, and
implement their AI. At the end of 24 hours, an automated tournament is
run, and prizes are awarded to the top three student
teams. Non-student teams are welcome to participate as well, but will
be ineligible to win prizes.</p>

<h3 id="registration">Registration</h3>

<p>Registration is $24 per team. This semester, teams will receive a $4
discount for each of their team members that is also a paid member of
Missouri S&amp;T’s ACM student chapter. Interested in joining Missouri S&amp;T
