<p><strong>If you are not an S&amp;T student, this announcement is just for you.</strong></p>

<p>Due to some bad timing<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, we weren’t able to procure temporary logins for campus machines.
However, we are working on setting up a way for you to access the Internet anyway.
You’ll be able to clone your team’s code and everything!</p>

<p>Make sure to bring a laptop or something.
Something with Wi-Fi capabilities.</p>

<p>The one catch is that you won’t have a shared network drive to work with.
But that’s OK.
You’ve got git!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Let me clarify: competitors are welcome to use campus machines to compete.
If you’re an S&amp;T student with a login, then you’re all set.</p>

<p><strong>If you were planning to get a temporary login from us, that’s not going to happen.</strong>
You will need a laptop or something in that case.</p>
