<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>

<p>The following terms are used in this document:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ACM</strong>: ACM refers to Missouri S&amp;T’s local chapter of the
Association of Computing Machinery. It is a Recognized Student
Organization (RSO) at Missouri S&amp;T.</li>
  <li><strong>SIG-Game</strong>: Missouri S&amp;T ACM SIG-Game is a special interest group
of Missouri S&amp;T’s local chapter of ACM. Its purpose is to host
MegaMinerAI once per semester. This includes logistics involved in
hosting the competition, as well as development of software
required to support it.</li>
  <li><strong>SIG-Game Developer</strong>: A member of SIG-Game who was exposed to
game-specific information for MegaMinerAI. SIG-Game maintains a
list of people who have had access to this information. SIG-Game
Developers are not eligible for any prizes.</li>
  <li><strong>Student Team</strong>: A team comprised entirely of currently enrolled
students. Each member may be either a full-time or a part-time
student. Students may be enrolled at any accredited educational
institution. MegaMinerAI is not limited to S&amp;T students.</li>
  <li><strong>Non-student Team</strong>: A team containing at least one member who is
<strong>not</strong> enrolled as a full-time student or a part-time student.</li>
  <li><strong>SIG-Game Developer Team</strong>: A team containing at least one member
who is a SIG-Game Developer. These teams are not eligible for <strong>any</strong>
prizes. However, Developers work hard to test MegaMinerAI, and often
want to test their own AIs in the arena.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="venue">Venue</h2>

<p>MegaMinerAI is hosted on Missouri S&amp;T’s campus in Rolla, Missouri.
Several rooms in Toomey Hall are reserved for competition. These
reserved rooms are considered the competition venue.</p>

<h3 id="traveling-competitors">Traveling Competitors</h3>

<p>Competitors who intend to travel to Rolla to participate in MegaMinerAI
should notify SIG-Game as soon as possible. This will enable SIG-Game to
request enough temporary accounts for competitors. Additionally, S&amp;T’s
IT department requires personal contact information from visitors to
enable network access for personal devices. If a visiting competitor
fails to inform SIG-Game of their travel plans, that competitor may be
unable to use S&amp;T’s network to obtain Internet access.</p>

<h2 id="schedule-and-phases-of-competition">Schedule and Phases of Competition</h2>

<p>All times are local (Central Time). Dinner on Saturday and breakfast
on Sunday are provided to competing teams that have paid their
registration fees. If lunch is provided on Sunday, that is also
provided to those teams.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The registration fee is $24 per team regardless of team size.</li>
      <li>Teams must pay their registration fees in cash.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A team will receive a discount of $8 for each team member who is a
dues-paying member of Missouri S&amp;T’s ACM chapter, a student with a 
valid student ID from a non-MST university, or bearing a free entry code.
    <ul>
      <li>For example, a team with exactly two member fulfilling the above criteria will
receive a $16 discount. Thus, that team’s registration fee
will be $8.</li>
      <li>Discount eligibility will be determined according to S&amp;T ACM’s
official roster.</li>
      <li>You <em>must</em> be a member of ACM at the time of competition to be
eligible for a discount.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Teams who do not pay the registration fee will be removed from the
competition.
    <ul>
      <li>SIG-Game Developers will attempt to contact unpaid teams before
removing them.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="teams">Teams</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Teams must have at least one member and may not exceed three
members.</li>
  <li>Teams must be formed on SIG-Game’s website prior to the start of the
competition. All code submissions must be made through this site.</li>
  <li>Competitors without teams (free agents) will have an opportunity to form
teams at the beginning of MegaMinerAI. SIG-Game will attempt to help
freeagents find teams to join.</li>
  <li>Prize eligibility varies based on the status of team members. Please
see the “Eligibility” section below.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="prizes">Prizes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Prizes are only awarded to eligible teams (see “Eligibility to win
prizes”).</li>
  <li>Prizes are awarded to <em>teams</em> not to individual members of a team.
    <ul>

passed to the compiled executable</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

described above, that AI will not be run in the final tournament</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Please note that the ShellAI provided to each competitor <strong><em>will
successfully compile and run as described</em></strong>. No changes are necessary
to compile ShellAI. In most cases, the <code>Makefile</code> and <code>run</code> do
not require modification to work with other AIs as well.</li>
  <li>Teams should ask SIG-Game Developers for help if necessary.</li>

<h2 id="receiving-help">Receiving Help</h2>

<p>During the competition, Developers will be available to answer any
questions that competitors may have. If you, as a competitor, have any
questions, please ask them for help. All SIG-Game Developers can be
easily identified, as they will be wearing the T-Shirt for the current
MegaMinerAI.</p>

<p>Teams may use online resources and publicly available, open source
libraries to assist their AI. However, teams are not allowed to reuse
personal code or libraries specifically designed for AI / MegaMinerAI
development. All development must be done by members of that team
during competition hours</p>

<h2 id="cheating-and-dishonesty">Cheating and Dishonesty</h2>

<p>If a team is suspected of cheating or sabotaging SIG-Game, MegaMinerAI,
or another competing team, SIG-Game will revoke the eligibility of the
saboteur’s entire team and remove that team from the competition. The
final decision to remove a team from competition will be made by the
Chair of SIG-Game.</p>

<p>Please note that this does not include game strategies. For example, if
an AI is written to perform well against one particular opponent,
SIG-Game does not consider this sabotage. If, however, an AI was
designed to exploit security vulnerabilities in SIG-Game’s
infrastructure or an opponent’s code, SIG-Game would consider this
actionable sabotage.</p>

<h3 id="examples-of-acceptable-and-unacceptable-actions">Examples of acceptable and unacceptable actions:</h3>

<p>Please note that these are examples. If you have questions about other
actions, please contact SIG-Game.</p>

  <li>Asking another team about their strategy
    <ul>
      <li>If they volunteer that information, that’s their decision.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="unacceptable">Unacceptable:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Exploiting security vulnerabilities
    <ul>

</ul>

<h2 id="ip-terms-and-conditions">IP Terms and Conditions</h2>
