<p>Thanks to Matt Nuckolls, Aluminati member and Arena architect,
MegaMinerAI 14: Plants has the most thorough final results of a any
competition ever. In total he ran the arena for 50,000 games, and from
those results I extracted
<a href="/static/pairwise_rate.csv">this CSV</a> of pairwise game
results, and created this pretty graph of how likely it is for each
team to beat each opponent:</p>

<p>While there is no doubt that Paper Pumpkin Posse deserved first place,
using this data its pretty unclear who should get second. Below is who
would get second using different measures of quality.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Highest Average Win Rate: <strong>Oversized Grow Lamp</strong></li>
  <li>Loses the least head to head matchups: <strong>The Mad Robotinists</strong></li>
  <li>Most likely to win random seed single winner tournaments (Pumpkin
removed) with probabilistic matchups: <strong>The Goldman Clause</strong></li>
  <li>Most likely to defeat first place team: <strong>Teem Bahd Spelers</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This game also contained a lot of non-transitive relationships. For
example The Deku Scrubs beats We Came For The Food who beats Teem Bahd
Spelers who beats The Deku Scrubs.</p>
