<h2 id="why-would-i-join">Why would I join?</h2>

<p>SIG-Game develops a number of open source projects that help us run MegaMinerAI and S&amp;T’s Artificial Intelligence Tournament Series.
These tools are developed solely by Missouri S&amp;T students and committed SIG-Game Alumni.
By developing for SIG-Game, you’ll have an opportunity to learn the ins and outs of our projects and contribute to them!
You’ll have a chance to learn new programming languages, software frameworks, development tools, and more.
Check out our <a href="/about/#Projects">projects</a> to get an idea of what we do.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="seems-overwhelming">Seems overwhelming?</h2>

<p>Don’t worry.
Every dev has to start somewhere!
We welcome Missouri S&amp;T students with <strong>CS 153</strong> experience or more.
Even if you have never programmed, <strong>you can still help</strong>!
We’re always looking for artists to design game art, fliers, t-shirts, and more.
A lot of works goes into making MegaMinerAI happen.
By getting involved early, you have the chance to get to know the other devs and prepare to develop for future MegaMinerAIs!</p>

<h2 id="but-i-want-to-compete-in-megaminerai-this-semester">But I want to compete in MegaMinerAI this semester</h2>

<p>No problem.</p>

<p>The only developers who cannot compete in MegaMinerAI are those who have specific knowledge of the game.
If you choose to work on other, unrelated components, you’re more than welcome to compete for prizes in MegaMinerAI.
The web and arena teams are always looking for developers, and they’re really cool people, too.</p>

<p>Granted, I’m on the web team, so I may be biased.
Join the web team.
Or the arena team.
I’m not your mom.</p>
