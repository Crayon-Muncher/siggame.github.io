<p>Last night, SIG-Game held a presentation to introduce our new developers, <a href="http://mst-mrdt.github.io/">S&amp;T’s Mars Rover Design Team</a>, and other friends to the wonderful world of Git.
We had an excellent turnout, and a lot of good questions from the audience.</p>

<p>As promised, the slides from the talk are posted below.
There are some additional resources listed, as well, which you may find helpful or interesting.</p>

<p>Though it requires some effort to learn, Git is a valuable skill for any developer.
It’s well worth the time you invest in learning it.</p>

<h2 id="thanks">Thanks!</h2>

<p>While I have the chance, I want to thank everyone who came to our event yesterday.
I had a blast giving this presentation yesterday, and I hope everyone was able to take something away from it.
It’s hard to compress all that is Git into an hour-fifteen presentation, but hopefully you’re excited to learn more about it.
Git is a valuable tool, and once you really understand it, it’ll be your new best friend.</p>

<p>-Wisely</p>
