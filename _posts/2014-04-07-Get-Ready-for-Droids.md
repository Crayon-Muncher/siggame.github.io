Still not sure if you want to compete? Looking for an opportunity to
get ready for game day? SIG-Game and Garmin will be hosting a to help
competitors prepare for MegaMinerAI in Computer Science Building
room 207. New competitors are encouraged to attend, so that they can
become more familiar with how MegaMinerAI works. However, there will
be plenty of SIG-Game developers at MegaMinerAI who can answer
questions on game day.
