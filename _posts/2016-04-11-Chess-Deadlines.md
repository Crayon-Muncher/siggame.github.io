## Final Deadlines for Chess Submissions

If you're writing a Chess AI to participate in [Missouri S&T's Artificial Intelligence Tournament Series](http://web.mst.edu/~tauritzd/AI-Tournament/), here are a few facts / deadlines that you should be aware of:

* The final deadline for AI submission is 11:59 PM on Monday April 25, 2016 (Central Time (DST)).
    * You must push your AI code to `MegaMinerAI.com` before the deadline.
    * You must submit your AI by visiting `MegaMinerAI.com` before the deadline. Pushing is not enough!
* We will not run submissions made after the final deadline.
* If you have submitted code to the Chess area, but you wish to opt out of the final tournament, you must notify Dr. T by email before the final deadline.

Any questions? Email us! Or email the course's Google Group.
