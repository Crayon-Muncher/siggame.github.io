This Wednesday Michael Wisely presented "Choose Your Own Django!" at the
ACM general meeting. He spoke about the powerful web framework, Django, which
we use to power our site for MegaMiner AI. If you missed the presentation and
want to see what you missed (or just want to relive the magic) check out the
[CYODj Presentation](http://blog.megaminerai.com/presentations/cyod.html).
If you are a little confused by the layout of the presentation website press "?"

If you want to learn more about Django and start developing with it go to
the official [Django Site](https://www.djangoproject.com/).
