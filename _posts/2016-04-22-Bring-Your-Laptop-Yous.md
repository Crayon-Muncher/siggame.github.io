**If you are not an S&T student, this announcement is just for you.**

Due to some bad timing[^1], we weren't able to procure temporary logins for campus machines.
However, we are working on setting up a way for you to access the Internet anyway.
You'll be able to clone your team's code and everything!

Make sure to bring a laptop or something.
Something with Wi-Fi capabilities.

The one catch is that you won't have a shared network drive to work with.
But that's OK.
You've got git!

**EDIT**

Let me clarify: competitors are welcome to use campus machines to compete.
If you're an S&T student with a login, then you're all set.

**If you were planning to get a temporary login from us, that's not going to happen.**
You will need a laptop or something in that case.

[^1]: Sorry!
