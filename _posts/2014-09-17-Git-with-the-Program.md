Last night, SIG-Game held a presentation to introduce our new developers, [S&T's Mars Rover Design Team](http://mst-mrdt.github.io/), and other friends to the wonderful world of Git.
We had an excellent turnout, and a lot of good questions from the audience.

As promised, the slides from the talk are posted below.
There are some additional resources listed, as well, which you may find helpful or interesting.

Though it requires some effort to learn, Git is a valuable skill for any developer.
It's well worth the time you invest in learning it.

While I have the chance, I want to thank everyone who came to our event yesterday.
I had a blast giving this presentation yesterday, and I hope everyone was able to take something away from it.
It's hard to compress all that is Git into an hour-fifteen presentation, but hopefully you're excited to learn more about it.
Git is a valuable tool, and once you really understand it, it'll be your new best friend.
