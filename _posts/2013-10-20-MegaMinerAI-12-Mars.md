### Discover Segfaults on other Planets!

We at Missouri S&T ACM SIG-Game are excited to announce our newest
game: *Mars*! Mars will be the twelfth MegaMinerAI hosted by ACM
SIG-Game.

### What's MegaMinerAI?

MegaMinerAI is an artificial intelligence (AI) programming competition
held in Rolla, Missouri on the campus of Missouri S&T. Competitors are
given 24 hours to learn the new game, develop a strategy, and
implement their AI. At the end of 24 hours, an automated tournament is
run, and prizes are awarded to the top three student
teams. Non-student teams are welcome to participate as well, but will
be ineligible to win prizes.

### Registration

Registration is $24 per team. This semester, teams will receive a $4
discount for each of their team members that is also a paid member of
Missouri S&T's ACM student chapter. Interested in joining Missouri S&T
ACM? Check out their
