        Tradebot Systems is a broker-dealer that trades
        stock for its own account.  Some days, we account
        for 5% to 10% of all stock trading in America.  We
        trade our own money and do not have customers.
      </li>
      <li>
        High Frequency Trading (HFT) is one of the most
        technically demanding applications.  We are always
        upgrading to the latest hardware.  Our stock
        trading system is one of the best in the world.
        When market data changes, our system can react and
        make new orders in nanoseconds.  Our decisions are
        based on analyzing huge data sets to determine when
        we have a statistical edge.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tradebot is privately owned by Dave Cummings.  We
        started in 1999.  We have around 60 associates and
        they all work out of our headquarters in Kansas
        City.

    <p class="lead">
      Sentry is an event logging platform primarily focused
      on capturing and aggregating exceptions.
    </p>

    <p>
      It was originally conceived at <a
      href="http://disqus.com/">DISQUS</a> in early 2010 to
      solve exception logging within a Django application.
      Since then it has grown to support many popular
      languages and platforms, including Python, PHP, Java,
      Ruby, Node.js, and even JavaScript.
    </p>

    <p class="lead">Open Source</p>

    <p>
      The hosted version of Sentry, that is, getsentry.com,
      is run by using the open source version of Sentry
      with several additional proprietary plugins. That
      said, nearly every change that is needed for the
      hosted version to work is actually made upstream
      first, usually in the form of an extensible
      interface.
    </p>

    <p>
      Want to learn more about the code? We host everything
      on <a href="https://github.com/getsentry">GitHub</a>.
